import SpeechRecognition, { useSpeechRecognition } from 'react-speech-recognition';

const SpeechToText = () => {
  const [text, setText] = useState('');
  const { transcript, listening, resetTranscript, browserSupportsSpeechRecognition } = useSpeechRecognition();

  if (!browserSupportsSpeechRecognition) {
    return <span>Browser doesn't support speech recognition.</span>;
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Microphone: {listening ? 'on' : 'off'}</p>
      <button onClick={SpeechRecognition.startListening}>Start</button>
      <button onClick={SpeechRecognition.stopListening}>Stop</button>
      <button onClick={resetTranscript}>Reset</button>
      <p>{transcript}</p>
    </div>
  );
};

export default SpeechToText;
